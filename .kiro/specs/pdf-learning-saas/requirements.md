# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing OpenSaaS template into a PDF-to-Learning Module SaaS platform that enables B2B teams to convert static PDF documents into interactive, trackable learning experiences. The system will leverage Mozilla AI's Docling for superior document processing and build upon OpenSaaS's existing authentication, payments, and analytics infrastructure.

3. WHEN the PDF is scanned or image-based THEN the system SHALL use OCR capabilities to extract text content
4. WHEN the document processing is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically segment content into digestible learning sections
5. WHEN images are present in the PDF THEN the system SHALL generate descriptive alt text using vision language models
6. WHEN the processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to customize and organize the auto-generated learning modules, so that I can ensure the content flows logically and meets our training objectives.

5. WHEN saving changes THEN the system SHALL preserve the original PDF structure as a fallback option

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to progress through learning modules with clear tracking and bookmarking, so that I can learn at my own pace and resume where I left off.

6. WHEN completing a section THEN the system SHALL automatically advance to the next section with user confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to assign learning modules to specific team members and track their progress, so that I can ensure compliance training is completed and identify knowledge gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing team members THEN the system SHALL allow invitation and role assignment (admin/learner)
2. WHEN assigning modules THEN the system SHALL allow selection of specific modules for individual team members
3. WHEN viewing analytics THEN the system SHALL display completion rates per module and per team member
4. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL show time spent learning for each user and module
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide team progress overview with exportable data
6. WHEN assignments are made THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to assigned learners

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a team administrator, I want to integrate with our existing Google Workspace for seamless team access, so that team members can use their existing credentials without additional login complexity.
