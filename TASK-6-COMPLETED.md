### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files Created:
1. `/src/learning-modules/progress-operations.ts` - Progress tracking backend operations
2. `/src/learning-modules/LearningViewerPage.tsx` - Main learning interface
3. `/src/learning-modules/ProgressDashboard.tsx` - Learning analytics dashboard
4. `/src/learning-modules/components/ProgressComponents.tsx` - Reusable progress components
5. `/src/learning-modules/components/ContentSearch.tsx` - Search functionality
6. `/src/learning-modules/components/BookmarkManager.tsx` - Bookmark management
7. `/src/learning-modules/README.md` - Comprehensive implementation documentation

#### Modified Files:
1. `/main.wasp` - Added new routes, pages, and operations
2. `/src/user/constants.ts` - Added learning navigation menu items
3. `/.kiro/specs/pdf-learning-saas/tasks.md` - Marked task as completed

### Ready for Development Testing
