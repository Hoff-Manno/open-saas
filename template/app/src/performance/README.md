   DOCLING_LOG_LEVEL=info
   ```

2. **Database Indexes** (run these SQL commands):
   ```sql
   -- User progress optimization
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_progress_user_module ON "UserProgress" ("userId", "moduleId");
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_progress_last_accessed ON "UserProgress" ("lastAccessed");
   
   -- Learning module optimization  
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_learning_module_organization ON "LearningModule" ("organizationId");
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_learning_module_status ON "LearningModule" ("processingStatus");
   
   -- Analytics optimization
